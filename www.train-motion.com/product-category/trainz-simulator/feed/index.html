<p>Astra IVA is a family of metro train used by Bucharest Metro, of which 504 vehicles (252 two-car trainsets) were built between 1976 and 1993 by ASTRA Vagoane S.A. in Arad, Romania. The trains used on the system are made up of various trainsets (rame) connected together. Each trainset is made up of two permanently connected train-cars (B&#8217;B&#8217;-B&#8217;B&#8217; formation) that can only be run together. Normally, 3 two-car trainsets are coupled together to make a complete six-car formation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 1994 and 1996, 42 vehicles (21 two-car trainsets) were refurbished by FAUR and Electroputere for service on Line M3, however for unknown reasons the refurbishment project was abandoned and these trainsets are currently stored at Berceni Depot. These trains were distinguished by a blue livery, and featured new technical equipment. An attempt to build more intermediate coaches to allow for a 3-car x 2 formation was abandoned in 1995. In 2000, most of the Astra IVA coaches were refurbished and equipped with new ATO and ATP signalling systems, allowing for partial driverless operation especially on Line M4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of July 2014, the Astra Arad rolling stock is approaching the end of its service life, so the cars are being gradually phased out in favour of newer Bombardier Movia and CAF trains. As of December 2014, 30 two-car trainsets (60 vehicles) are in commercial service.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[<p>The first advanced model of 060 EA locomotive, first released in 2011 for Trainz Railroad Simulator on our past website RTS. The locomotive is working on a custom script made by Solaris, that will simulate most of the real world functionalities of this locomotive. However we will no longer provide future updates or support for this product due to theÂ migration to Train Simulator 2016 (Railworks).</p>
