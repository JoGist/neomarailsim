				<description><![CDATA[<p>This repaint of the 47 class locomotive, also called "Cocutza" by enthusiasts, belongs to the Bucharest depot and is one of the most recent modernized versions of the 060 EA originals. Modernized in the year 2009, this locomotive was used by "CFR Calatori" to service passenger trains throughout the country for almost 10 years now. This used and rugged version is the actual look of the locomotive during the last few years 2015-2019 before it underwent repairs and painting in June 2019. To this day, this locomotive remains one of the most commonly used machines in the fleet.</p>

Later on in 1993 when was taken back to Electroputere for a general revision, was replaced by 512 electrical loco from Brasov Depot. In the year 2006 has been modernized with ICOL and has received the actual red-white color scheme. Due to the holder in 2012 has been custom painted with a large front V shape and on the sides was written the actual class 41-0106-9. In the present belongs to Timisoara depot and is also known as the queen of Banat county.</div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>476-692-5 is the first advanced model of 060 EA locomotive created for Train Simulator 2018. The locomotive has a custom script that will simulate almost all the real world capabilities and a 3D model built in accordance with the original technical drawings and blueprints, at real scale. Also, the locomotive contains photorealistic HD textures and real recorded sounds for every action you will perform in the simulator. The 47 class locomotive is one of the most recent modernised versions of 060 EA originals, built for freight trains but for a short while was used also on passenger trains. This is the actual look of the loco when it was servicing at &#8220;CFR Calatori&#8221; passenger trains, back in 2009 &#8211; 2010.</p>
<p>There was a long journey, getting from the real thing to the game simulated loco, and quite a &#8220;bumpy road&#8221;. It required a lot of pictures, sound recording, measurements and research for every aspect of its functionalities. All these efforts were made to create the best user experience. I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy this loco as much as I did when working on it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add to cart and see the railway from the train driver&#8217;s seat!</p>

<p>The locomotive has Swedish origins, dating back to 1966, when the first one was on the ASEA (Almana Svenska Electrica Actiebolaget). In Romania, electric traction was introduced in 1963, when technical tests began, and in 1966 the first such locomotive was circulated in our country. The Electroputere Craiova factory bought the license in 1970 and started to produce the locomotive until 1991, when the factory was involved in maintenance and modernization. At that time, it was considered the only locomotive capable of pulling heavy-duty trains at high altitudes with a speed up to 80 km/h. This locomotive was also shipped to other countries such as Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and China.</div>
