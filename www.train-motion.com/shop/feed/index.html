				<description><![CDATA[<p>This repaint of the 47 class locomotive, also called "Cocutza" by enthusiasts, belongs to the Bucharest depot and is one of the most recent modernized versions of the 060 EA originals. Modernized in the year 2009, this locomotive was used by "CFR Calatori" to service passenger trains throughout the country for almost 10 years now. This used and rugged version is the actual look of the locomotive during the last few years 2015-2019 before it underwent repairs and painting in June 2019. To this day, this locomotive remains one of the most commonly used machines in the fleet.</p>
